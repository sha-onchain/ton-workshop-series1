## üìù Instructions

### 1. Create Your Toncoin Wallet

Choose one of these non-custodial options and follow the wallet video:

- **Tonkeeper (mobile & extension):** Download from ton.org and secure your 24-word seed phrase ([TON Blog](https://blog.ton.org/how-to-create-and-start-using-wallet "How to create and start using your first TON wallet?"))
- **@wallet Bot (in Telegram):** Zero-install, in-chat wallet powered by TON Connect ([The Open Network](https://docs.ton.org/v3/guidelines/ton-connect/wallet "Connect a wallet | The Open Network"))
- **Web Wallet (wallet.ton.org):** Browser-based, secret-phrase backup ([TON](https://ton.org/wallets "Get a wallet - TON"))

### 2. Fork & Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/<repo-name>.git
cd <repo-name>
git checkout -b add-your-wallet

```

_Fork first via GitHub UI, then clone locally._ ([The GitHub Blog](https://github.blog/developer-skills/github/beginners-guide-to-github-creating-a-pull-request/ "Beginner's guide to GitHub: Creating a pull request"))

### 3. Add Your Wallet Address

- Open `wallets.txt`
- Append a new line in the format:
EQA-xidpMmv1WT4x_tpHN-pNS0PRO3mNWSD7TdCh9i-JuZM0


### 4. Define Wallet Types in PR Description

In your PR body, answer:

1.  **What is a custodial wallet?**  
With custodial wallets, a third party like an exchange or custodian manages your private keys for you
2.  **What is a non-custodial wallet?**  
With non-custodial wallets, you have full control over your keys and the security of your crypto. 


### 5. Commit & Push Changes

```bash
git add wallets.txt
git commit -m "Add my Toncoin wallet address and explain wallet types"
git push origin add-your-wallet

```

### 6. Create the Pull Request

- Navigate to your fork on GitHub
- Click **Compare & pull request**
- Select **main** as the base branch and your branch as the compare branch
- Paste your wallet entry and wallet-type answers into the PR description
- Click **Create pull request** ([GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request "Creating a pull request - GitHub Docs"))
